        <h2>What Is A System?</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
            A system is a set of things working together as parts 
            of a mechanism or an interconnecting network; 
            a complex whole.

        <h2>Making Systems</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
            What is the best way to a system? It is probably 
            very dependant on the exact system that is being 
            created. That however does not mean there are not general principles 
            that can be applied to making systems that make things 
            easier or accelerates the process, at least in the 
            vast majority of cases.  
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When making a system, the goal is to apply changes
            to it in such a way that it will at some point in the 
            future be able to satisfy set goals and/or discover new
            goals that can be used to justify better systems. 
        </p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Systems can be very simple and small. Systems can be very 
            large and complex.
